# Experiments with timing information for HAL and SDV
In this repository we collect experiments involving Hardware Abstraction Layer and software component timing constraints.
Currently, we perform the following timing analysis: order and probability of misses using [IF](./IF-models/) and reaction time extraction from traces [MRTCCSL/bin/reactions](./mrtccsl/bin/).
Both use simulation data, generated by either MRTCCSL or [Simpy](./simulation/).

## IF-models
This directory contains experiment results for the label transition system (LTS) generation and probabilistic temporal logic querying.
In order to run the full experiments, the following software must be installed:
- CADP (https://cadp.inria.fr/)
- IF (https://www-verimag.imag.fr/~async/IF/)
- Python (https://www.python.org/)

The IF-models directory contains timed automata expressed using the IF language.
C2 and C3 have the same timed automata.
So, there is only one directory for them.
To generate the LTS of a model, users can run the build.sh script.
For C1, this will only build the LTS.
For C2 and C3, the script will also run CADP to perform probabilistic querying; then, the python script will be called to plot the verdicts.

The simulators directory contains an alternative way to generate execution traces.
