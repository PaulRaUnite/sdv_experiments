# Experiments with timing information for HAL and SDV
In this repository we collect experiments involving Hardware Abstraction Layer and software component timing constraints.
Currently, we perform the following timing analysis: order and probability of misses using CADP probabilistic query and reaction time extraction from traces [MRTCCSL/bin/reactions](./mrtccsl/bin/).
Both use simulation data, generated by either MRTCCSL or [Simpy](./simulation/).

The lts-generation-and-query directory contains the experiment results using the IF toolset for generating LTSs and the CADP toolbox to do probabilistic querying.

The simulation directory contains an alternative way to generate execution traces using Simpy.
To run the simulator, execute the python code with the following command:
```
python simulator.py
```
