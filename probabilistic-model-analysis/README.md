This directory contains examples of probabilistic model analysis experiment results.
In order to run the full experiments, the following software must be installed:
- CADP (https://cadp.inria.fr/)
- IF (https://www-verimag.imag.fr/~async/IF/)
- Python (https://www.python.org/)
- Java (https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

The [examples](./examples/) directory contains the probabilistic model analysis of running example described in the paper and a more complex version of that example.
The [PTS-computation](./PTS-computation/) directory contains the software tool to compute a PTS for a given LTS and a set of traces.
